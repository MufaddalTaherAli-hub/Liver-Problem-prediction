# Liver-Problem-prediction
Symptoms of liver disease can vary widely, but they often include abdominal and leg swelling, easy bruising, changes in the color of stool and urine, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). In some cases, there may be no symptoms at all. I have developed a model to predict whether a patient has a liver problem or not.
